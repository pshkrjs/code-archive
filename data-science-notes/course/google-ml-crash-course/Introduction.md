# Introduction

> Machine Learning is a valuable tool to help engineers make sense of their data.

The course is designed to make you a skilled practitioner of the art.

### Three major learnings
1. Reduce the time spent on programming
    * Instead of making rules manually for a spell checker, use off-the-shelf machine learning model, feed it some examples and a more reliable program in a small fraction of time
2. Customize and scale your products
    * Instead of creating the rules for multiple languages for a spell checker, use the same machine learning model with language-specific examples
3. Complete seemingly "unprogrammable" tasks
    * Instead of creating a program which can recognize voices of people, use a machine learning model to identify people given samples of their voice

### Philosophical reason for mastering machine learning

> Machine learning changes the way you think about problems. Software engineers are trained to think logically and mathematically; we use assertions to prove properties of our program are correct. With machine learning, the focus shifts from a mathematical science to a natural science: we're making observations about an uncertain world, running experiments, and using statistics, not logic, to analyze the results of the experiment. The ability to think like a scientist will expand your horizons and open up new areas that you couldn't explore without it.
